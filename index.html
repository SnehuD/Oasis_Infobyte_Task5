                considering it was a rare form of cancer. Even though the
                chemotherapy worked for some time and it seemed like it showed
                results, Nayak's health kept deteriorating and cancer spread to
                his entire body within one year.

                makeup artist do his fatherâ€™s makeup as he began his final
                journey towards his heavenly abode. In his latest interview with
                a news daily, Nayak's son, Vikas opened up on how the family
                supported him and stayed with him throughout the difficult
                phase.
